## SlowRonaPolicies.
Change point analysis to quantify the impact of African government policy interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The  project focuses on quantifying the statistical significance of  public health policies introduced by the Kenyan government to slow down the spread of the pandemic, COVID-19. 
Data used for the analysis is obtained from the John Hopkins University covid-19 cases database. Precisely, the number of new cases per day will be used to conduct the analysis. 

The 'behind the scenes' of the model used is in [this repository](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference). The repo takes care of all the steps from data scraping to model formulation.
